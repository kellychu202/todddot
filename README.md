## Inspiration
As three students living and learning at home, we have all felt the monotony of quarantine come in waves. Like children on an endless road trip, we seem to all be asking "are we there yet?" with no response and nothing to play with but the back of a headrest.

In quarantine, it can be especially hard to branch out and try new things. Taking naps to pass the time, or laying on the couch staring blankly at the ceiling contemplating life can get boring. That's where Extra Hour comes in!

Whether you are looking for new activities to try, routines to pick up, or more structure in your daily life, Extra Hour will provide the relief you have been looking for.

## What it does
The website takes in user interests, as well as desired interests. When the user picks a date that they're free, they can drag and drop suggested events onto that date. Then there's an option to export it to Google Calendar or an .ics file, so the user can take their personalized day into the calendar of their choice.

## Future Updates
We hope to develop features to curate activities based on an individuals profile and their experience with previous activities. Incorporating personalized recommendations, Extra Hour will suggest movies, music, recipes, and hiking trails to try as well as any socially distanced events in the area. Extra Hour will also allow users to adjust time limits and duration.

Fitting your lifestyle and schedule, Extra Hour will include an option to import your Google Calendar. Another exciting feature will provide a Surprise Me option, creating a completely randomized schedule pushing users to try things they never would have on their own.

## How we built it
We used Figma to generate the general style, and HTML+Github pages to host a real-time prototype.
